# Rails Template

Whenever I find myself excited about a new idea, I get to the point of creating a new app and all of a sudden I find that the configuration has killed my excitment. I just wanted to start building, not deciding which version of rails to use and whether it should do this or do that

The Stack:

- Rails 7
- Vite Ruby instead of Webpacker.
- React
- InertiaJS
- Cuprite for driving headless-Chrome

### Rubocop

- Run `bundle exec rubocop --auto-gen-config` to generate a todo list of existing exceptions
- Run `rubocop -a` to autocorrect offenses
- Run `rubocop -x` to fix layout issues
